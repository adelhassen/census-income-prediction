# Income Classification Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores key factors influencing whether an individual earns more or less than $50,000 per year. Using U.S. Census data, we apply machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and insights that can inform policymakers and educators. The goal is to identify demographic and socio-economic features that correlate with higher income levels, providing valuable insights into economic inequality.

The project employs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model. By focusing on a classification task, we aim to predict income categories based on various attributes such as age, education, work situation, and marital status. These insights can be leveraged to create targeted interventions for workforce development, education, and public policy.

## Business Impact
- **Policymakers**: Develop targeted upskilling programs and wage policies.  
- **Nonprofits & Educators**: Guide career and education choices to improve economic mobility.  

## Approach
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Visualize data, normalize features, encode features.  
- **Modeling**: Train classification models to predict income level. Light GBM Classifier was the final model.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance and interpret key factors driving income classification.
